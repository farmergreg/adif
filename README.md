# ‚ö° World's Fastest ADI Parser for Go

This library provides high-performance processing of [ADIF](https://adif.org/) (Amateur Data Interchange Format) ADI files used for ham radio logs.
It's idiomatic, developer-friendly API seamlessly integrates with your codebase and the go standard library.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üöÄ **Blazing Fast**: 3-20x faster than other ADI libraries; more than 2x faster than Go's native JSON marshaling!
- üí° **Memory Efficient**: Up to 1400x fewer memory allocations than alternatives
- üîß **Developer Friendly**: Clean, idiomatic Go interfaces
- üî¨ **Battle Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
go get github.com/hamradiolog-net/adif@latest
```

1) [Document](./example_document_test.go): Complete ADI file operations using `io.Reader`/`io.Writer`
2) [ADIFReader](./example_adireader_test.go): Stream-based parsing of ADI records using `io.Reader`
3) [Record](./example_record_test.go): Single record operations using `io.Reader`/`io.Writer`

## Benchmarks

JSON marshaling is included as a baseline for comparison.

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

This parser achieves high performance through the following optimizations:

### Architecture

- Implements an O(n) time complexity streaming parser
- Zero-copy techniques to minimize memory operations
- Efficient buffer reuse patterns
- Simple API

### Performance Optimizations

- Leverages stdlib I/O operations with SSE/SIMD acceleration depending upon your CPU architecture
- Smart buffer pre-allocation based on discovered record sizes
- Optimized ASCII case conversion using bitwise operations
- Custom base-10 integer parsing for ADIF field lengths

### Memory Management

- Minimal temporary allocations during field parsing
- String interning for common ADI field names to reduce allocations and memory use
- Constant memory overhead during streaming operations
- Dynamic buffer allocation based on learned field counts

## Performance Considerations

Alternative implementations explored:

1. Non-Streaming / Read ADI File into Memory:
   - 20% performance improvement over current streaming implementation
   - Rejected to maintain streaming capability for large data sets

2. slice of fields instead of map:
   - L1/2/3 cache-friendly design
   - O(n) lookup time instead of map O(1) lookup time.
   - For small values of n where n is less than ~40, this is faster than the map based implementation.
   - 15% faster parsing than current map-based implementation on test files.
   - 30% faster writing performance (it is much faster to iterate over a list than a map)
   - Rejected in favor of better API ergonomics
   - Still considering switching to this implementation because it is common to see ADI records with less than 40 fields.
   - Downside is that above ~50 fields, the O(n) map lookup is faster than the O(n) list lookup.

Future optimization possibilities:

- A perfect hash function with a custom map implementation.
- Direct SIMD implementation for parsing operations.
